You’ve been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You’ll be given access to every students math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Observations

*	Top performing schools in this district were all categorized as Charter schools. In the “scores by school type” analysis, charter schools outperformed district schools in every category (average reading score, average math score, % passing reading, % passing math and overall passing)
  *	This is also seen in the “top performing schools by passing rate” analysis which has Charter schools in each of the top 5 positions.
* In the “scores by school spending” analysis we can see that the amount of money schools spend per student is actually inversely related to student performance. Where schools spent less than $585 students did better and where they spent more than $645 per student, student scores were worse.
  * While this is what the data show, and we can draw this conclusion, there are also a lot of other factors that go into scores and cost per student, so this is not the only conclusion.
  * All we can say definitively is that there is not necessarily a correlation between school spending and scores.
